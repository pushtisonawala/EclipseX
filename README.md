# EclipseX

## Overview
EclipseX is a secure data wiping and certification platform designed for organizations, recyclers, and individuals. It ensures NIST 800-88 compliant erasure and generates tamper-proof digital certificates for audit and compliance.

## Problem Statement
Millions of devices are recycled or repurposed every year, but improper data wiping exposes sensitive information to breaches, identity theft, and regulatory risks. Existing solutions are often non-compliant, lack transparency, and fail to provide verifiable proof of secure erasure. There is an urgent need for a trusted, NIST-compliant wiping tool that guarantees data destruction and issues tamper-proof digital certificates, empowering organizations and individuals to recycle devices safely and confidently.

## Solution
- NIST 800-88 compliant secure wiping for Windows, Linux, and Android
- Tamper-proof digital certificates for proof of erasure
- Bootable ISO and desktop app for flexible deployment
- Cloud portal for certificate management and verification
- Open-source transparency and modular design

## Technology & Implementation
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python (secure wiping logic, certificate generation)
- **Certificate Tools:** Cryptographic signing, PDF and QR code generation
- **Device Support:** Windows, Linux, Android, bootable ISO
- **Portal:** Cloud-based certificate management and verification

## Customer Segments
- Government & Defense
- Banks & Hospitals
- E-waste Recyclers
- Journalists & NGOs
- Small-medium data centers
- Educational institutions
- Developing countries with budget constraints
- Organizations with in-house compliance teams

## Future Aspects
1. **Global Expansion & OEM Integration:** Scale the platform for international markets and partner with device manufacturers to offer built-in secure wiping and certification features.
2. **Advanced Automation & AI Auditing:** Integrate AI-driven compliance checks and automated audit trails for large enterprises, making data destruction and verification seamless.
3. **Support for Emerging Devices & Regulations:** Extend secure wiping and certification to IoT, cloud storage, and new device types, while adapting to evolving global data protection laws.
